## Project Description: Shawty – Modern URL Shortener & Link Tracker

**Shawty** is a full-stack URL shortener and link management platform designed to simplify sharing and tracking web links. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js for backend logic, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, and powered by Supabase for database and authentication, Shawty offers a seamless, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Instant URL Shortening:** Convert long, unwieldy URLs into concise, shareable links in seconds.
- **Link Management Dashboard:** View, organize, and manage all your previously shortened links in a personalized dashboard. Each link entry displays its original URL, the shortened version, and additional metadata for easy reference.
- **Analytics & Tracking:** Track key metrics for each short link, including the number of clicks, device and location information, and referrer data. Visualize usage patterns with interactive charts and graphs.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration powered by Supabase, ensuring your link data is private and accessible only to you.
- **Custom Short Links:** Optionally create custom aliases for your short URLs, making them more memorable and brand-friendly.
- **QR Code Generation:** Instantly generate QR codes for any short link, making it easy to share links offline or in print.
- **Modern UI/UX:** The interface leverages Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a clean, intuitive, and responsive design across devices.
- **Error Handling & Validation:** Robust form validation and helpful error messages ensure a smooth user experience.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Other:** QR code libraries, charting tools for analytics, and modern React hooks for state management and API calls.

**How It Works:**
1. Log in or sign up to your Shawty account.
2. Enter a long URL and optionally specify a custom alias.
3. Instantly receive a short link and QR code.
4. Access your dashboard to view all links you’ve shortened, track their performance, and manage them as needed.

Shawty is ideal for anyone looking to simplify link sharing while maintaining full control and insight over their URLs. Whether you’re an individual, marketer, or developer, Shawty combines ease of use with powerful tracking and management features.
